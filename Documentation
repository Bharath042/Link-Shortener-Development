Link Shortener Development


Introduction:
This document outlines the design choices, features, and challenges encountered during the development of the provided code. The code aims to address a specific problem or task, and various decisions were made to achieve the desired functionality.

Features:
User Input Handling:
Efforts have been made to handle user input securely and robustly, preventing potential issues like buffer overflows or unexpected program behavior. This includes input validation and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
Error Handling:
The code incorporates a robust error-handling mechanism to gracefully handle unexpected situations. This helps in identifying and addressing issues efficiently, providing meaningful feedback to users or developers.
Optimization:
Optimization techniques may have been applied to improve the code's efficiency, considering factors such as time and space complexity. This ensures that the code performs well even when dealing with large datasets or complex computations.

Design Choices:
Modular Structure:
The code is structured in a modular fashion to enhance readability, maintainability, and reusability. Each major functionality or task is encapsulated within separate functions or modules, promoting a clean and organized codebase.
Object-Oriented Design (if applicable):
If applicable, an object-oriented design approach might have been chosen to represent entities as objects with attributes and methods. This design choice can improve code structure and promote a more intuitive understanding of the problem domain.

Clear Documentation:
Documentation has been incorporated to provide clear explanations of the purpose and functionality of each module, function, or class. This is crucial for collaboration, maintenance, and future development.
